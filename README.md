# Dataset API Sample Project 

A ready to go sample project illustrating how to use the Dashbuilder's DataSet API

Instructions on how to configure a project as well as how to use the API can be found [here](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder/tree/master/dashbuilder-backend/dashbuilder-dataset-core).

The Data Set API [tests](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder/tree/master/dashbuilder-backend/dashbuilder-dataset-core/src/test/java/org/dashbuilder/dataset)
 are also a good source of knowledge about the proper API usage.
