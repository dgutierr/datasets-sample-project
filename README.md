# Dataset API Template Project 

Sample project template illustrating how to setup and use the Dashbuilder's DataSet API

An initial introduction to the API can be found [here](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder/tree/master/dashbuilder-backend/dashbuilder-dataset-core).

The Data Set Library [tests](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder/tree/master/dashbuilder-backend/dashbuilder-dataset-core/src/test/java/org/dashbuilder/dataset)
 are also a good source of knowledge about the proper API usage.
